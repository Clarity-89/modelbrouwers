Hi {{ username }},

You just attempted to login, but your account is not activated. You can activate on the following link: {{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{{ activation_url }} (copy and paste this link in your browser).

After activation, you will be logged in automagically and redirected to the pagewhere you can set/change your password.

The account you're activating, is a single-sign-on account. With the same account you will have access to the forums, albums and all future modules of the website! Eventually the kit-reviews module and the shop will be integrated with this account.

If you run into problems, just reply to this e-mail.

Happy modelling,
your faithful {{ site_name }} administrators
